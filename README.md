### Project Description


 ###   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project: Learn to code like a PRO <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first project, up until now i've only learned bits of html, css and javascript as languages for web development. In this project i've learn how to write code in PUG(ex Jade) which help me write faster the code. <br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build the structure of the page, elements like  div, headers, paragraphs and so on was made use of HTML and to style those elements i made use of Sass which is a CSS library but help us to structure the style in a nicer and better looking/reading way.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for content, the i did try to make a replica of w3schools.com and with help from CodeTap i've learn how to do that in the right way, what i mean the right way is by make use of JavaScript, if i've made that website by myself i would write it with alot of hard hand-code, which is quite a bad pratice. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cool thing i've learn is how to make dynamic content using JavaScript as programming language, it can be seen in menu section, as well as header, subheaders.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things i've learned but not mastered yet, how to deploy a project on github, how to use JavaScript to write code in a smarter way, some CSS topics like Grid System and Sass library and ofcourse not forget about the "paper" implementation of an ideea before translate it to code.
