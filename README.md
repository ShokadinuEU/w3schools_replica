### Project Description


iii -  Indeed that PUG language help us so much as a beginer, not pay so much atention on closing tags just focusing on what each tag does and learn them properly. Aswell nice intro and well explained to project deployment on github pages.ï»¿<br> 
iv -  i like the power of SASS, how nice and organized you can style HTML elements aswell the grid system for page layout how nice is explained on 'paper'.<br>
v - JavaScript, i really love to see it in action, dinamicaly pass the classes from one element to another, thats what attract me the most, manipulate dom elements with JavaScript :X <br>
