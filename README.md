### Project Description


 ###       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My intro into web development world <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first project, up until now i've only learned bits of html, css and javascript as languages for web development. For this project since i am a beginner i've used PUG, ex Jade to help me write faster the code(helping me by eliminate self-closing tags). <br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build the structure of the page, elements like div, headers, paragraphs and so on was made use of HTML and to style those elements i made use of Sass which is a CSS library but help us to structure the style in a nicer and better looking/reading way; And as for the hard part like dynamic injection of content  i made use of lovely programming language called JavaScript.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for content, the i did try to make a replica of w3schools.com and with help from CodeTap i've learn how to do that in the right way, what i mean the right way is by make use of JavaScript, if i've made that website by myself i would write it with alot of hard hand-code, which is quite a bad pratice. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things i've learned but not mastered yet, how to deploy a project on github, how to use JavaScript to write code in a smarter way, some CSS topics like Grid System and Sass library and ofcourse not forget about the "paper" implementation of an ideea before translate it to code.
